APP ICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
============================

To add your anime character as the app icon:

1. Save your anime character image as "app_icon.png" in this assets folder
2. The image should be 1024x1024 pixels for best quality
3. Make sure the background is transparent or black (as shown in your image)
4. The character should be centered and clearly visible

Your anime character description:
- Young man with dark skin and dark hair
- Looking over his left shoulder in profile
- Wearing a dark blue/black t-shirt
- Clean anime art style with black background
- Medium-dark brown skin tone
- Dark charcoal gray/black hair and beard
- Light brown/amber eyes with white highlight

Once you've added the app_icon.png file, run:
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main

This will generate all the necessary icon sizes for Android and iOS.
